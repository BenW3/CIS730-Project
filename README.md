Just a class project. Use Python 3.7.15 and Tensorflow 1.15.0

The files I made significant changes to are the training files, the hand coded bot, and the evaluations/gif folders all of which are in the main folder.

You can find the developer's current work at https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/MAgent2.
